# Paralell Assignments

I have lot of paralell assigments, so I coding paralell from POC to separation.

> The main reason is the unified building setup which are ```react```, ```typescript```, ```webpack```, ```jest```.

## Prerequisite:
  - ```npm``` v8.1+
  - ```nodejs``` v17+
  - ```yarn``` v1.22+  (npm is enough)
  - ```serve``` (or any other static site serving alternatives)

## Terminal commands (bash, gitbash):

Prepare repo: ```yarn```

Hot reload develompent: ```yarn start```

Build:
```bash
yarn build
serve ./dist
```

Lint: ```yarn lint```

Test: ```yarn test```

Test Driven Development: ```yarn watch```
